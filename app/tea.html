I haven't made a web page for myself in a long time, work, play, tacos have kept me from buildiding or updateing any pages.   I don't know when or how, but one day not too long ago I decided that enough was enough, i hadn't put anything online in months and I just wanted to build something new, something fresh.   So I did what I always do in such situations, buy a silly domain name,  load up multiedit, and start writing some htmuole.  This site in it's entirety took me a little over a week to build whenever I had a free second to waste on my computer that I don't turn on as much as I'd like.   This is grilledcheese,  a new type project thats mostly old.   I hope you enjoy both the site and my type work.   It would be nice if you even bought some of my type work, and even nicer if you were so kind to me as to send me email.  I do have an email address you know.   somewhere around <A href="mailto:tea@tacoland.com">here</A>.</TD></TR></TABLE></TD><TD VALIGN="TOP"><IMG SRC="img/border/r2.gif"></TD></TR></TABLE>
