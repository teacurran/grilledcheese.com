						<FONT FACE="airal,helvetica"><B>Why are fonts priced differently?</B></FONT>
						<BLOCKQUOTE>
                                    			Fonts are priced based on the number of
                                    			characters in the font, how long it the font took to
                                    			create, and whether or not that font is being
                                    			distributed through other commercial distributors.
			                                Font prices on grilledcheese.com vary from 1 to 30
                                    			dollars depending on these factors.

						<FONT FACE="airal,helvetica"><B>Can I buy fonts online with my credit card?</B></FONT>
						<BLOCKQUOTE>
							No, grilledcheese.com currently does not support credit card orders or orders
							online.  Work is being done to get online ordering, but theres no promise as
							to when it can be avaliable.  The shopping cart on the site is meant to be
							used as more of a calculation tool for font pricing.

						<FONT FACE="airal,helvetica"><B>Why can't I add items to my shopping cart?</B></FONT>
						<BLOCKQUOTE>
							Make sure that when you click the "order now" button from a font preview page,
							that you web browser has cookies enabled.  The site needs to use cookies to
							remember what it is that you have in your shopping cart.  You can enable
							cookies in the preferences menu of your web browser

							No.

						<FONT FACE="airal,helvetica"><B>Can I trade you pants for fonts?</B></FONT>
						<BLOCKQUOTE>
							Kikwear's are good 36+ waist only.  But its probably cheaper to
							just buy the fonts.

						<FONT FACE="airal,helvetica"><B>Can I Put your fonts on my website?</B></FONT>
						<BLOCKQUOTE>
							No.   Please do not put my fonts for download on your website.  This rule
							applies to both commercial and shareware fonts.  Please put a link to the
							font instead, that would be great.  There are a few places on the web that
							I have approved for distributing a few my shareware fonts, but these sites are
							very scarce.   Questions about this?  <A Href="mailto:tea@grilledcheese.com">Email Me</A>.
